Explanation:
Unit testing ensures that your API behaves as expected under various conditions.
By using pytest, you can write tests that automatically check the functionality of your API endpoints.
This is crucial for detecting bugs early and ensuring code reliability.

Why pytest is Important:

It allows for automated testing, so you can quickly verify the correctness of your code.
It improves code quality by making sure that each endpoint behaves as expected in different scenarios.
It provides an easy way to run tests on every change, improving the development workflow.

How to Implement:
1.Install pytest and fastapi testing tools:
    pip install pytest pytest-asyncio httpx

2. Write a basic unit test to check if POST /students/ creates a new student:

# test_main.py 
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from main import app  # assuming your FastAPI app is defined in 'main.py'

client = TestClient(app)

def test_create_student():
    response = client.post(
        "/students/",
        json={"name": "Test Student", "email": "test@student.com"}
    )
    assert response.status_code == 200  # Ensure success
    assert response.json()["name"] == "Test Student"  # Check the name field
    assert response.json()["email"] == "test@student.com"  # Check the email field

def test_create_student_invalid_email():
    response = client.post(
        "/students/",
        json={"name": "Invalid Student", "email": "invalid-email"}
    )
    assert response.status_code == 400  # Ensure error for invalid email
    assert "detail" in response.json()  # Check if error message exists


In Action:

test_create_student() ensures that when a valid student is created, it returns a successful response and the correct data.
test_create_student_invalid_email() ensures that when an invalid email is used, the API responds with a 400 status code and an appropriate error message.
